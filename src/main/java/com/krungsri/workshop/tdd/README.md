This workshop is designed to help you start or improve
your [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

The [TDD](../tdd) you will see in this workshop are designed to demonstrate the advantages and technicalities of TDD.
The intention is to represent real-world scenarios, however sometimes that will not be possible in favour of simplicity.

[Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) or Test First Development is a process

then implement the source code.

This process uses the **red/green/refactor** pattern and consists of the following steps:
