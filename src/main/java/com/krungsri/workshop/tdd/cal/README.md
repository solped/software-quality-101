### Tasks

Implements a [calculator](./Calculator.java) to support sum operation via TDD approach

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Given numbers are positive, when call sum operation, then result should be positive
- Given numbers are negative, when call sum operation, then result should be negative
- Given numbers are opposite, when call sum operation, then result should be zero

---

#### Example

Given numbers are `positive`, when call sum operation, then result should be `positive`

```shell
1 + 2 = 3
```

---
Given numbers are `negative`, when call sum operation, then result should be `negative`

```shell
-2 + -3 = -5
```

---
Given numbers are `opposite`, when call sum operation, then result should be `zero`

```shell
5 + (-5) = 0
```
